## Main Information

TODO app is an app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks they want to work on. These actions touch upon the four aspects of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application.

I developed this as a training for react.js and to showcase my skills.

This application integrate React useState and useEffect Hooks. React Hooks allow for functional components to have a state and use lifecycle methods, allowing you to avoid using class components and have more modular and readable code.

ToDo app is an excellent app to practice hooks, state, style and data manipulation.
